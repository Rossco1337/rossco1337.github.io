player stat editor panel working. encounters and enemies now (partially) read from json. enemy sprite loaded from json reference. <br />
still no actual gameplay but i learned from the first week of this project that the backend is much more important than the frontend. <br />
having a working "attack" button means nothing if you have to pull away the foundation and fix it after every commit.<br />

oh yeah, if you're reading the console, there ARE actually 2 enemies but they're drawn on top of each other. i was going to flip the first one upside down until i got around to adding new enemy containers but i wanted to upload this today.
